# Free-to-use 3D Model gallery
This GitHub is a little galery / blender models warehouse where I store blender files that I consider well mades as well as an picture of them. You can use them all as you want!

I recommend you to go on the wiki if you want both the preview and the blender files close to each other and also if you're not sure of what you want *they will be filtered by category*

If you want to do a request for an item, ask them in the issues tab! Most of the time, I don't know what to modelize so your ideas are welcome!

It is still possible that I will import other pictures without blender files because they will be part of works *like as a request from a company* but there will be enough point of view so that you can make the model by yourself!

If you see a blender file without picture, it means that the picture is still being rendered *thanks to the sheep it community, they will be avaible faster*

You can also simply request some colors variation on some pictures I post here. I won't deny a lot of request, but especially not those *exception made if you ask that from a 3D model I lost the blender file linked to it or some commercial ones where I usually never gives the Blender file but only pictures from different point of view*!
