# Free-to-use 3D Model gallery
This GitHub is a little galery / blender models warehouse where I store blender files that I consider well mades as well as an picture of them. You can use them all as you want!
I recommend you to go on the wiki if you want both the preview and the blender files close to each other and also if you're not sure of what you want *they will be filtered by category*
If you want to do a request for an item, ask them in the issues tab! Most of the time, I don't know what to modelize so your ideas are welcome!
